                    applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms,
                    including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part
                    of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is
                    subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to
                    grant whatever relief would be available in a court under
                    law or in equity. The arbitration rules also permit you to
                    recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The arbitrator’s
                    award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may
                    be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
                    jurisdiction.

                    The parties understand that, absent this mandatory
                    provision, they would have the right to sue in court and
                    have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some
                    instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs
                    of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited
                    in arbitration than in court.
