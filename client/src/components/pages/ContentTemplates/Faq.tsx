          <h2>What is Vantage Sports?</h2>
          Vantage Sports is the marketplace that connects aspiring college
          athletes to high-caliber college players and alumni. The Vantage
          Sports platform will allow college athletes to instruct aspiring
          college athletes through the form of 1-on-1 instruction, small-group
          training, clinics, film and virtual instruction, or through a general
          1-on-1 Zoom to get advice or ask questions.
          <br />
          <br />
          We provide access to top-notch coaching at a fraction of the cost
          imposed by comparable private clubs, camps or training services while
          also supporting hard-working student athletes that, until recently,
          have had little opportunity to capitalize on their name, image or
          likeness. The goal is to offer college athletes the opportunity to
          finally profit on their lifelong pursuit of athletic excellence and
          unlock the potential of youth athletes across the nation.

          <h2>
            How do aspiring athletes and parents find a coach on Vantage Sports?
          </h2>
          Whether you are a parent using the platform to book a lesson for your
          child or an aspiring college athlete yourself, Vantage Sports makes it
          easy to find the perfect college athlete to level-up anyone’s game.
          Browse the main training session section and search by sports,
          position, training type or university. If you have an athlete in mind,
          feel free to search through the coaches section to browse college
          athlete coaches that are actively looking for training opportunities.
          Once you find what you want, view your future coach’s availability,
          click a time to request a personalized training session and prepare to
          lace ‘em up.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alternatively, some college athletes will be posting the link to their
          Vantage Sports profile in their social media, instagram, or twitter
          bios. This will be another simple way for fans to find and get access
          to their favorite college athletes?

          <h2>
            Is it legal for college athletes to make money off a service like
            this?
          </h2>
          Effective July 1st, 2021, the NCAA’s board of directors has officially
          suspended the organization’s rules prohibiting athletes from selling
          the rights to their names, images and likenesses. Certain states have
          their own legislation permitting college athletes to profit off their
          name, image and likeness that also took effect on July 1st which will
          supersede NCAA’s policy.
          <br />
          <br />
          In all cases, college athletes are required to get approval from their
          compliance officer before activating their Vantage Sports account.

          <h2>
            How does a college athlete start making money through Vantage
            Sports?
          </h2>
          Sign-up for college athletes is quick and easy. Athletes sign up on
          our website and fill out a profile highlighting themselves as student
          athletes. Vantage Sports then completes a verification process (24 to
          36 hours) to verify the identity of student athletes. Once verified,
          college athletes can offer training sessions at the time and place of
          their choosing (including virtually), and not their availability for
          1-on-1 training.
          <br />
          <br />
          After the training is complete athletes receive payment in a method of
          their choice and review their earnings at any time within their
          coaching dashboard.

        <div id="covid" className="content-block">
          <h2>What about COVID-19?</h2>
          The COVID 19 pandemic has changed the landscape of sports from pee-wee
          through the professional level. Restrictions imposed by states and
          towns have in certain cases restricted organized sports entirely.
          However, in most cases outdoor organized sports continue in some
          capacity.
          <br />
          <br />
          In order to ensure the safety of college athletes, parents and young
          athletes, Vantage Sports will prohibit indoor coaching in any capacity
          and instruct coaches to maintain a 6ft social distance from youth
          athletes. Vantage Sports will also restrict any sort of group training
          to a maximum of 10 participants until pandemic conditions improve
          considerably. Research has shown that outdoor interactions have a very
          low rate of transmission, so it is in the best interest of all parties
          to restrict coaching to outdoor-only for the time being.

          <br />
          We provide liability insurance of up to $1M dollars to protect both
          parties involved in sports coaching and training activities.
          Additionally, full contact activities are not permissible through
          Vantage Sports coaching sessions. Our staff will get directly involved
          with any injuries or other issues that may arise during a coaching
          session.
