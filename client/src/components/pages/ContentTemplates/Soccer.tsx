                      As soccer players are one of the earliest sports to commit
                      to, college coaches tend to look at grades primarily from
                      freshman year to junior year when they are deciding to
                      offer prospective athletes.

                    <li>
                      Set good study habits, become organized, and create good
                      time management skills (as this will become more and more
                      important as school and soccer become more demanding)
