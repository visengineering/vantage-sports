        Vantage Sports will reach outside the world of sports by partnering with
        the Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism. Founded by Doug and Laura
        Flutie, the organization aims to help people and families affected by
        autism live life to the fullest. They aim to create a world where people
        with autism lead productive lives where they are included, respected,
        and actively engaged in their communities. To help make this dream a
        reality, Vantage Sports will donate 1% of its gross revenue to the
        foundation.
