                Vantage Sports stores basic User data on our servers including
                name, email, phone number, address, and username. Payment
                information is processed and stored by our partners or service
                providers. Personal Data about Users is stored within the United
                States. The Services are only intended to be used inside the

                other regions with laws governing data collection and use,
                please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your

                laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as
                the laws of your own country. By providing your Personal Data,
                you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with
                this Privacy Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, our platform is

                control procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized
                access to your information. We choose these safeguards based on
                the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and
                store and the current state of technology. Our outsourced
                service providers who support our operations are also vetted to
                ensure that they too have the appropriate organizational and
                technical measures in place to protect your information. <br />
