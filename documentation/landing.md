Standalone Landing optimized for Ads

We have created a raw html + css landing page located at [/client/public/landing.source.html](../client/public/landing.source.html).

The final version is landing.html. In order to compile source to that version use:

- For landing.source.html HTML apply first https://www.toptal.com/developers/html-minifier/ and then https://www.willpeavy.com/tools/minifier/ and save as landing.html
- Remove `.source` in landing.html, so it references .css and .js files.
- For landing.source.css CSS apply https://www.toptal.com/developers/cssminifier and save as landing.css
- For landing.source.js JavaScript apply https://www.toptal.com/developers/javascript-minifier and save as landing.js
